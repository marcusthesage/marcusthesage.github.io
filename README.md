Welcome to the Fisherman's Sandwich Builder (BETA v0.1.0)!
   Fisherman's is a concept delicatessen brand that I want to bring to life one day.
       The Fisherman's Sandwich Builder is a game that lets you build a sandwich, name it and download/screenshot it so you can share.
*Instructions*   
1. Click an ingredient type to begin.
2. Select an option for each ingredient type. You can only have multiple selections for condiments and vegetable ingredient types. The "Reset" button clears the current sandwich.
3. Once you have your desired options for each ingredient type, name your sandwich and click "Save". (Note: Saving your sandwich downloads your sandwich as an JSON object.)
   Screenshot to share with friends!
4. There is a special sandwich, the Fisherman's Special, if made, the winner will win a free future Fisherman's T-Shirt!
   
Please feel free to email your sandwiches to yndgaming@gmail.com , I would love to see everyone's creations! 
ANY and ALL feedback is appreciated. This is my first project so I know there are things that can be better. Feel free to check out my code! I need it!
